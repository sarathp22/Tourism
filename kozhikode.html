  Although the city's official name is Kozhikode, in English it is sometimes known by its anglicised version, Calicut.The word calico, a fine variety of hand-woven cotton cloth that was exported from the port of Kozhikode, is thought to have been derived from Calicut.It is the historical capital of Kerala as the history dates back to 1498 AD when Vasco da Gama landed in Kappad, near Calicut.</p>
