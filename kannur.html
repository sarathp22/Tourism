Being Kerala's only drive-in beach, it attracts the attention of many tourists around the year. The whole concept of drive-in beaches is that you can drive right on the sandy shores of the beach- it is not very often that you get to drive along a 4 km long shoreline that offers an open road with no traffic and a stunning view.

                You can drive through the shallow end of the water giving your car a natural car wash as you roll down the windows to breathe in the cool wind that caresses in your face and you might never want to walk on a beach ever again. If you get tired of driving around the beach, which is very unlikely, you can wade in the beautiful turquoise waters for a swim. You can also stop for some refreshments - some of the most lip-smacking dishes of the Malabar cuisine. Treat the adrenaline junkie in you and go out for some paragliding, parasailing, powerboating and many other water sports. The Muzzhapilangad Drive-In Beach is the perfect weekend getaway to blow off some steam and spend quality time with your loved ones.</p>
